In recent years, his focus has shifted toward machine learning, and he currently teaches at the master's program in Computer Science at the Bodø campus in this field, through the courses **FYS-2021 (Machine Learning)** and **FYS-3033 (Deep Learning)**.

He has participated in various national and international forums with contributions in the field of deep learning and is interested in applications within the maritime and clinical sectors.

He has supervised three master's students in this area and is now an academic mentor for the startup **Eagle AI**, which recently received **STUD-ENT funding** (Innovation Norway, 2024). The company's product is based on a deep-learning machine learning framework that he supervised one of the aforementioned master’s students in developing.
