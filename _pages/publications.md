## My most recent publications
1. This is a work I did with one of my master students, which was based on an experiment with making the autoregressive TrAISformer into a categorical harbor prediction model:

	Løvland, A., Fredriksen, H., Bjørndalen J. (2025). *Predicting the destination port of fishing vessels utilizing transformers*. Maritime Transport Research, (8), 1-14. [https://doi.org/10.1016/j.martra.2025.100131](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.martra.2025.100131)

2. This work was the culmination of investigations on the possibility to cluster clinical time-series, and was performed as a team of clinicians, deep learning researchers like me and a master student.

	Fredriksen H., Burman P., Woldaregay A., Mikalsen K., Nymo S. *Categorization of phenotype trajectories utilizing transformers on clinical time-series*. ICMLT '24: Proceedings of the 2024 9th International Conference on Machine Learning Technologies, 311-316.
