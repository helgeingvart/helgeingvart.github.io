I was the committee leader for the evaluation of the PhD candidate Marc Weitz at the department of Computer Science, UiT. His thesis was titled "Device-based measurement of lifestyle-related variables from the hip - Methods for 24 h wear protocols under free-living conditions"[The disputas](https://uit.no/nyheter/artikkel/kortnytt?p_document_id=881591) was held at 17.06.2025.

I've been part of three evaluation committees for positions as PhD during 2024 and 2025, in which I was leading two of them.
